# Schooi's Multitool

I AM NOT EVEN GOING TO LIE, this is the MOST POWERFUL batch multitool I **have ever seen**, let alone **MADE**. I swear, this is unbiased. ðŸ‘€

Schooi's Multitool is a versatile collection of **OVER 70** utilities and tools designed to simplify various tasks and workflows for developers and everyday users alike. From IP Geolocation to .zip Password cracking, Schooi's Multitool offers a wide array of functionalities to streamline your work.

Features
-

- IP Geolocator
- SMB Bruteforcer
- Tweaking
- .zip Password Bruteforcer
- Text to Speech
- Windows User Manager
- IP Logger
- Info Stealer
- Windows Activator
- Windows Destroyer
- URL Shortener
- Various App Installers
- and many more, all from the command line!

Note: You may notice that github says that 30% of this is in Python. That is not true. I wrote about 300 lines to make a Discord nukebot in python. It is more like 15%. The multitool itself and the tools are mostly written in batch and Powershell.

Requirements
-

No libraries required, since this is made in batch. The only requirement is Windows 10+

Installation
-
> [!NOTE]
> The installer and some other scripts of SMT get flagged by Antiviruses like Windows Defender and Malwarebytes. I suggest you disable real time protection on your antivirus.
> See a VirusTotal scan [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d914d16a3d1b97e0ab84d20e5f53b9b1b0540e87cb31ec92947f4eae97e4eb58/detection).

[^1]: Installer.bat, uninstall.bat & setup.bat in releases are obfuscated for anti-piracy reasons.
[^2]: Because it is obfuscated, antiviruses flag it as an "exploit".
