Schooi's Multitool
---------

I AM NOT EVEN GOING TO LIE, this is the MOST POWERFUL batch multitool I have ever seen, let alone MADE. I swear this is unbiased. ðŸ‘€

Schooi's Multitool is a versatile collection of OVER 60 utilities and tools designed to simplify various tasks and workflows for developers and everyday users alike. From IP Geolocation to .zip Password cracking, Schooi's Multitool offers a wide array of functionalities to streamline your work.

Features
-

- IP Geolocator
- SMB Bruteforcer
- Tweaking
- .zip Password Bruteforcer
- Text to Speech
- Windows User Manager
- IP Logger
- Info Stealer
- Windows Activator
- Windows Destroyer

- Various App Installers
- and many more, all from the command line!

Note: You may notice that github says that 30% of this is in Python. That is not true. I wrote about 300 lines to make a Discord nukebot in python. It is more like 15%. The multitool itself and the tools are mostly written in batch and Powershell.
