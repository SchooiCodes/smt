[^1]: You may notice that github says that 30% of this is in Python. That is not true. I wrote about 300 lines to make a Discord nukebot in python. It is more like 15%. The multitool itself and the tools are mostly written in Batch and Powershell.
[^2]: The .exe installer made in NSIS gets flagged by many AVs, including Windows Defender, due to it downloading SMT's files. Many pieces of malware download .bat files, and are called "droppers", so AVs immediately flag anything that does the same. For that reason, use the commands or disable your antivirus instead.
